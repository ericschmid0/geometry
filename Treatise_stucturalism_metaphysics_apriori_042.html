treatise will examine the possibility for a foundational system which conceptually unifies ordinary mathematics (category theory, topos theory, or homotopy type theory are the options). For that matter, this treatise will discuss structure in the sense of philosophical structuralism (not to be confused with French structuralism) and if category theory provides a structuralism as Awodey suggests. Recent research after the univalence axiom has demonstrated a new contender; does Homotopy Type Theory provide a foundation for mathematics? We will borrow Negarestani&rsquo;s notion of &lsquo;localization&rsquo; and try to provide a more rigorous context for a &lsquo;site&rsquo; directly within topos theory, which has ramifications for any ontological framework. Moreover, we will discuss the necessary background ontology to any foundational &lsquo;topos&rsquo; which will depend on the use of the Tarski axiom. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2">We will address the issue of the &ldquo;synthetic a priori&rdquo; and whether we can, in the Kantian manner, treat geometry as the &ldquo;a priori&rdquo;, either at the macro-level, as Einstein has shown, where the Minkowski spacetime develops a &ldquo;spacetime&rdquo; where the only invariant is the speed of light; or on the meso-level, &ldquo;the relativity of simultaneity&rdquo; where &ldquo;distant simultaneity &ndash; whether two spatially separated events occur at the same time &ndash; is not absolute, but depends on the observer&#39;s reference frame&rdquo;; or on the micro-level (of neurons) where perception uses a &ldquo;cut loci&rdquo; which is a geometric form (from differential geometry) in so that we can develop a &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">neurogeometry</span><span class="c5 c2">&nbsp;of vision&rdquo; as Jean Petitot has done. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2">Furthermore, we will attempt to articulate some &ldquo;self-evident structural Truth&rdquo; on the &ldquo;conceptual level&rdquo; itself. At the &ldquo;conceptual&rdquo; level of any epistemology, I will be arguing for a de-ontologized metaphysics to accommodate the ineffability of the Real and the </span><span class="c2 c23">potentia</span><span class="c5 c2">&nbsp;of the conatus (as in Leibniz or Spinoza), but rather than philosophize this ontology through some transcendent background (the realm of virtuality in Deleuze or &lsquo;the ontological&rsquo; for Heidegger), we shall wish to view logico-deductive abstraction itself (like in group theory) as a means to articulate intrinsic invariants of material which need not be embedded in a surrounding Euclidean space for its measurement a.k.a thinking (see: Gauss&rsquo; Theorema Egregium). Through this immanent hypostatization of material which scientifically determines its own place/count reflexively (in the super-structuralist sense of Althusser, Ranciere, Badiou) but is, simultaneously, completely hypothetical (since it is derived from axioms), one can consider an intensive definition that is completely relative (Grothendieck&rsquo;s perspective) which allows for ontological involvement, yet suspends its own background ontology through the complementarity of the duality (Laruelle) between &lsquo;theorem&rsquo; and &lsquo;axiom&rsquo; (or for that matter, between &lsquo;actual&rsquo; and &lsquo;virtual&rsquo;). This Laruellean approach may be likened to eliminative structuralism, where &lsquo;statements&rsquo; get regimented/deflated into analytic propositions which are trivially/vacuously true for a system through assuming the hypothetical &lsquo;hypostatization&rsquo; of the theory. Because of the vacuity of any deflated statement, this approach flattens the underlying ontology of a philosophical theory through a qualifier parameter beforehand. I will discuss the presuppositions of Time which is based on a real-valued function which is parameterized and argue against &lsquo;the time of philosophers.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c5 c2">We will still attempt to demonstrate the underlying ontology of &lsquo;technique&rsquo; charting from the father of individuation Gilbert Simondon; to the Deleuzian system of becoming from the Idea (&ldquo;The Ideal Synthesis of Difference&rdquo; in Difference &amp; Repetition); to Laruelle&rsquo;s de-ontologized material experimentation uni-lateral to the Real; to Rene Thom&rsquo;s discussion of the aporia of the technical opposition between continuity and discontinuity. The de-ontologized metaphysics of Laruelle, which is axiomatically derived (as opposed to a theological doctrine or philosophical transcendence) is explained here:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Philosophers, Laruelle insists, do not know what they are doing. They are never doing what they say or saying what they are doing &ndash; even and especially when they purport to be able to legitimate their philosophical decisions in terms of some ethical, political or juridical end. The </span><span class="c2 c0">theoreticist</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;idealism inherent in decision is never so subtle and pernicious as when it invokes the putative materiality of some extra-philosophical instance in order to demonstrate its &#699;pragmatic worth&#700;. To condemn Laruelle for excessive abstraction on the grounds that the worth of a philosophy can only be gauged in terms of its concrete, extra-philosophical (e.g. ethical, political or juridical) effects is to ignore the way in which extra-philosophical concretion invariably involves an idealized abstraction that has already been circumscribed by decision... In non-philosophy, radical axiomatic abstraction gives rise, not to a system or doctrine inviting assent or dissent, but to an immanent methodology whose function for philosophy no one is in a position to evaluate as yet. Ultimately, then, non-philosophy can only be gauged in terms of what it can do. And no one yet knows what non-philosophy can or cannot do. (Brassier 2003, 34)&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2 c0"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2">At the level of physics, an Aristotelian realism makes the most sense, which is known in the sciences as &ldquo;ontic structural realism&rdquo;. Why? Epistemology, at the level of structure, is either &ldquo;in the thing&quot; realism, &quot;before the thing&quot; Platonism or &quot;after the thing&quot; eliminative structuralism. So if one is of the realist camp, one would say that relativity exists &quot;in situ&quot; on the macro scale of large bodies, but that these structures don&rsquo;t appear in everyday life is due to a scale problem. Or similarly, catastrophic hysteresis means there is a lag between those infected with coronavirus between one week and next, but only when a pandemic does in fact occur. But can we accept the entities described by physics as really existing? Certainly it is true that special relativity is true </span><span class="c2">as framework</span><span class="c2">. But as Negarestani has explained, van Fraassen did not believe electrons really existed.</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;Negarestani has previously articulated an ontology defined by epistemology, which is not reducible to mere &lsquo;ontological monism&rsquo;. We will counter that categorical-structuralism provides the basis for a variant form of realism that is similar to set-theoretic structuralism, where &ldquo;structures are isomorphism types (or representatives thereof) within the set-theoretic hierarchy.&rdquo; But the ontological commitments of such a system need not presuppose a &ldquo;rich ontology of sets.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;The question still remains if category theory is isomorphism invariant. One could consider topos theory instead. But there is still the question of Grothendieck universes needed for topos theory. We will not be able to rigorously consider the ontology of topos theory unless we consider the Tarski axiom which presupposes an inaccessible cardinal (i.e. infinity). But, for example, Andrew Wiles in his proof of Fermat&rsquo;s Last Theorem did not need to even invoke these uncountable universes. The solution I believe to this foundational problem would be to pursue inquiry into a (further advanced) field known as &lsquo;Homotopy type theory,&rdquo; which views things as instances, known as tokens.</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2">Does the recent work in Homotopy Type Theory present an argument for structuralism, which is a completely top-down (by its </span><span class="c2">intensional</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;nature) approach to math (as opposed to bottom-up constructions)? &nbsp;The &ldquo;ontic structuralist realist&rdquo; James Ladyman has argued HoTT is a foundation.</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;Awodey has said it provides a philosophical structuralism.</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c5 c2">&nbsp;Other examples of this notion of top-down classification in mathematics include Gaussian curvature (which is an invariant for different types of elliptic, hyperbolic, or Euclidean geometry), Klein&rsquo;s group-theoretic programme of non-Euclidean geometry (which are group invariants, such as cross ratio, for different types of affine or projective geometry), and category theory. &nbsp;This top-down organization of mathematics presents a multiplicity of &lsquo;case(s)&rsquo; through general &lsquo;invariants&rsquo; (topological, group-theoretic or categorical) which constrain the (group-theoretic or categorical) objects into varying geometries (Klein&rsquo;s method) or algebraic structures (category theory).</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2">The &ldquo;highest truth&rdquo;, to build off Alex Boland&rsquo;s point about &quot;craftsmanship&quot;, follows what he calls intuitive compositionality or Spinoza&rsquo;s intuition. In a categorical context, objects are literally only unique &ldquo;up to isomorphism&rdquo; and morphisms are the generalizing tool, which leads back to the question of &ldquo;the conceptual level&rdquo; mentioned before. To qualify an idea by Alex Boland where he said &ldquo;I believe everything is a matter of aesthetics simply because all of epistemology is </span><span class="c2">autopoietic&quot;</span><span class="c2">, I would counter with &ldquo;everything is a matter of aesthetics since all epistemology is conceptual. Conceptual mathematics &amp; the axiomatic method are geometric. Therefore, everything, by way of epistemological delimiters, is a matter of </span><span class="c2">aesthetics&quot;</span><span class="c2">. This is &quot;conceptual poetry&quot; (from the axioms) as opposed to &quot;autopoiesis&quot; because instead of a homeostatic system (in the case of Luhmann and the imperfect model), there is a sense of &quot;sheen&quot; in the multivariate calculus of a manifold in which the &quot;geometric intuition&quot; is pure, as if pre-constituted. Pure mathematics is a matter of aesthetics according to the mathematician G.H. Hardy. I am not arguing for Platonic Forms but rather for some form of Aristotelian realism, where logic and geometry converge, and that structure takes place in exact terms within the Real itself but requires &quot;hypothetical&quot; actualization, such as the thought-experiment of Einstein&rsquo;s special relativity. There is no universal truth in the heavens. The Real is a necessary cause but the actuality need only be sufficient and not directly manifest (de-actualized worlds that have a unilateral source, the </span><span class="c2">Laruellean</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Real). The conceptual invention of topological machinery, for example in a topos, allows for radical approaches between knowing subject and the ostensibly fixed object. &ldquo;Base changes</span><span class="c2">&rdquo; allow</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;for the freedom to move from one level of &ldquo;open sets</span><span class="c2">&rdquo; to</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;another in the navigation of a &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">topos&rdquo;</span><span class="c2">. The invention of this conceptual machinery which formalizes intuition at the highest level of abstraction is novel for &ldquo;unify[ing] deep insights on arithmetic (number) and geometry (form)&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span class="c2">. The conceptual invention of the epistemologically unmoored geometry from the wellspring of the individuation/ontogenesis is a becoming. These &lsquo;germs&rsquo; (in a &lsquo;section&rsquo; of a &lsquo;stalk&rsquo;) are, to use Rene Thom&rsquo;s words, salient forms which have been individuated from the &lsquo;</span><span class="c2">pregnance</span><span class="c2">&rsquo; emanating from &lsquo;source-forms&rsquo;. This is morphogenesis, of the realm of aesthetic &ldquo;creation&rdquo;, individuated from the &lsquo;sheaf of sets&rsquo;. Dynamic perspectives. But through the </span><span class="c2 c23">axiomatic</span><span class="c5 c2">&nbsp;nature of such a geometry, we hope to defend a de-ontologized metaphysics that is not an &ldquo;abusive hypostasis.&rdquo; The axiomatic method allows pure fabrication, but freestanding and geometric.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c5 c2">In imperfect cases, such as Luhmann&#39;s autopoietic systems (social or dynamical), these predictive determinisms have outliers which aren&rsquo;t predicted. The question ultimately remains whether or not, all systems beyond thermodynamics (such as economics, for example) are ergodic! Alex Boland has made the point that cybernetics is not ergodic. This is all to suggest that at a deeper level, there are cases when systems abide to larger &quot;extant forms&quot; and are not simply reducible to the recalibration of a system (predictions which only hold up to the case of 99.9%, which is why there are outliers such as the Great Depression). That is, there are forms which are algebraically precise in a geometric/topological sense (for example, see topological invariants such as compactness, that every open cover as a finite subcover) and are therefore, more intuitive. We could take an economic space and ask if it is convergent. If it is metric then the space will be compact when it is complete and totally bounded. So if we can locate some upper bound for the supply and demand, and if all the limits are contained in the metric space, then it would be complete. So the value of a product (in economics) may follow some heuristic such as the &quot;law of diminishing returns,&quot; but this is only a principle and not naturalized since how can we define the topology of the space of utility (in the same sense, Moore&#39;s law is not exact in a mathematical sense either). Some truths exist in their algebraic exactness of terms, which can&#39;t be simplified to the heuristic of a system. One example is generalizing basic arithmetic to a topos and logic becomes inherently geometric. One can think of the integers as geometric through &quot;the semiring of tropical integers&quot; as a sheaf of sets over a topos (Alain Connes). The case of the logic of catastrophe modeling or Monte Carlo simulation, which is the &#39;autopoetic&rsquo;, is prone to &#39;error&#39; and different from the more precise geometric formalism, that is still axiomatic. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2">At the formal level (in the manner of Hilbert&rsquo;s formal system for geometry), eliminative structuralism which is &ldquo;schematic&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;assertoric,&rdquo; makes the most sense epistemologically, in the sense that objects can be viewed from the exterior rather than interior, through the categorical approach: all that matters is &ldquo;arrows only&rdquo; (morphisms between objects). &nbsp;I will conclude the Treatise with a postscript which discusses the social sciences and the mathematical presuppositions of cybernetics/economics which are problematic. A Java program would not be able to compute certain functions due to uncountability.

Very roughly, an elementary topos is a category possessing a logical structure sufficiently rich to develop most of &ldquo;ordinary mathematics&rdquo;, that is, most of what is taught to mathematics undergraduates.

Negarestani even uses the terminology of &lsquo;site&rsquo; and &lsquo;topos&rsquo; at times in the essay. One of the primary methods of epistemology in this Treatise will be modeled on this approach of the localization of the concept, which Negarestani characterizes by its epistemological depth to &ldquo;unmoor&rdquo; the subject from fixed points and &ldquo;cancel&rdquo; any archetypal relation between subject and object, immersing the subject directly within the &ldquo;navigational landscape&rdquo; :</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c2 c0">Just like the desert that is one and the same and precisely because of its homogeneity we don&rsquo;t have access to its landscape, the monism of nature does not allow us to know nature without organizing an epistemic breakage. Ontologically, nature does not distinguish itself from itself. Monism is in this sense an ontological reality that demands a necessary epistemic strategy: Exactly because of this excess of informational homogeneity&mdash;a desert that is one and the same everywhere&mdash;we can&rsquo;t immediately approach nature or navigate it. The nature-culture division is an epistemic division, not an ontological one. From the possibility of epistemic traction, this division is necessary and far from rigid. It provokes approaches to nature hitherto unimagined. To claim that everything is nature is at best an indulgence in the vulgarity of the obvious and at worst, a complete blindness to the epistemic conditions through which we are able to progressively make sense of nature. The bimodalization of the universal to its global and local horizons is a navigational strategy which must be conceived through a local rupture, a regional discontinuity. To create or conceive this local rupture is the basic gesture behind the formation of the concept as a local site distinguished by its qualitatively differentiated information. It is the concept as a regional breakage or local disturbance in the qualitatively homogenous information that provokes approaches and pathways impossible in the absence of the epistemic rupture. Trying to understand nature without an epistemic division, solely through the ontological monism, is an appeal to mysticism. It results either in an ineffable conception of nature or an image of nature as a reservoir of meanings and stories about itself. Once we insist that the world is a repository of meanings, that it has stories to tell the subject without any demand for the subject to create a necessary epistemic condition, then we have already committed to conserve a stable relation between the knowing subject and the world. The world is always facing the subject as if it wants to tell a story, there is no need for the subject to destabilize its given status, to epistemically uproot itself so as to procedurally navigate the landscape. The subject of the world as a ready-made object of experience and a reservoir of meanings is quite stubbornly an anthropocentric and conservative form of subject even though it claims to be completely the opposite. Localization should be understood in terms of bringing about an epistemic condition that once rigorously pursued cancels any conserved relation between the knowing subject and the world, rather than anchoring the subject in an specific place, it unmoors the subject within a navigational landscape. This is the deracinating effect that registers itself as a condition of enablement insofar as it liberates epistemic possibilities which until now had remained captives of the tyranny of here and now&mdash;that is, the knowing subject tethered to a local domain and a privileged frame of reference. Localization has obvious implications for thought not only because we ourselves are local instantiations within the terrestrial horizon, but also from an epistemological perspective: the concept as the space through which we gain traction on the world is a local horizon. As the most fundamental unit of knowledge, the concept is a local horizon, a locally organized space of information within a vast inferential economy and immersed within the general structure of knowledge. So the question of localization allows us a form of systematic study of the local context, and in particular a systematic analysis of conceptual behavior. In this sense, we can say that localization is the ultimate procedural framework of thought. It&rsquo;s a procedure &ndash; even a gradualist and stepwise procedure &ndash; because, as I shall argue, the local is not rooted. Its analysis is not a matter of zooming in and out on a specific point. Instead the examination of the local requires a procedure to follow it in a navigational context, in relation with other local horizons, via different directions and addresses. No axiomatic commitment at the level of the local makes sense unless through this procedure, which is to say, only when we localize parameters and orientations or generally speaking identify what makes a local domain local. The local is not a fixed point in space, it is a mobile framework immersed within a generic environment. Its internal analysis is always coupled with an external synthesis</span><sup class="c2 c0"><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup></p><p class="c4 c15"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c4 c15"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2">To get a sense of what Negarestani exactly means by &lsquo;localization&rsquo;, one would need to familiarize oneself with the work of Rene Thom. This sentence &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">The bimodalization of the universal to its global and local horizons is a navigational strategy which must be conceived through a local rupture&rdquo; is a direct allusion to Rene Thom. Thom was famous for his Catastrophe Theory where a local rupture creates an epistemological breakage in the fabric of homogeneous information. Catastrophe Theory was thought to be a method for predicting catastrophes but the applications of the field proved to be not so fruitful. But the largest import the field had on mathematics was Thom&rsquo;s invention of the term &ldquo;attractor,&rdquo; which would be important in the field of chaos theory. One of the main reasons predictions and applications were not obtainable was that Thom&rsquo;s approach was completely topological and was an analogical hermeneutics of data and therefore a &nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c21">qualitative</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;study of quantitative data. The motivation of this approach was to undertake a natural philosophy project which could unify the body and soul into a geometric object.</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup><span class="c5 c2">&nbsp;To get a better sense of the procedure of localization, we will examine one of the seven elementary catastrophes which Thom describes:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 548.00px; height: 509.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 548.00px; height: 509.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2">This example is known as the &ldquo;cusp catastrophe&rdquo;. Here a local rupture creates a sudden jump between the upper stable region and the lower stable region. For Negarestani, this divergence creates the possibility through epistemology of grasping the ontology of a monist space. In the picture as x,y change in the cusp region, z is very unstable. A good example of a catastrophe would be a Hurricane. Pictured is what is known as hysteresis or a lag between one state and the next state. A good example of hysteresis (a lag) would be the # of cases of coronavirus between one week and the next week where the # of cases detected grows as new testing detects newer cases. As Dr. Fauci said, &ldquo;When you are dealing with a virus outbreak, you&rsquo;re always behind where you think you are.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt23" id="ftnt_ref23">[23]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;The key to localization is the liberation of the subject from the tyranny of a fixed point or moment or perspective. As Negarestani says, &ldquo;the deracinating effect that registers itself as a condition of enablement insofar as it liberates epistemic possibilities which until now had remained captives of the tyranny of here and now&mdash;that is, the knowing subject tethered to a local domain and a privileged frame of reference.&rdquo; The paradigm of a &ldquo;conserved relation&rdquo; between subject and object in the speculative sense is overthrown. The philosophy of armchair philosophers is over. Negarestani goes on to describe the </span><span class="c2 c21">recursive</span><span class="c5 c2">&nbsp;anatomy of the process of &ldquo;localization&rdquo;:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;The question &lsquo;where is the concept?&rsquo; demands a methodology for approaching or seeing the concept from a perspective that is adjacent, rather than from a perspective that is fixed upon it. This is by way of a recursive procedure in which we say &lsquo;where is the concept?&rsquo; and then we repeat this procedure. In other words, localization (Where?) is combined with recursion. Since localization is an analytico-synthetic procedure that unbinds new alternative addresses for a local site/concept, then repeating localization means that new paths branch from the existing paths. This diffusion of pathways or addresses for a local horizon is registered as a ramified path structure where new alternative addresses and opportunities for local-global synthesis are progressively unfolded. As I argued the concept as a local site is fringed with possibilities of alternative reorientations. The ramified path structure suggests a form of step-wise navigation via these possible reorientations through which the concept is simultaneously studied, traced, revised and constructed. We ask &lsquo;where is x?&rsquo; then we repeat the question over and over. Every time we localize x, we see or approach it from a new address in the environment in which x is immersed. In our example of a point, the point can be seen not only according to new variable coordinates but also according to different layers of organization. It can be conceived arithmetically, geometrically, algebraically, topologically, and so forth. Accordingly, the operation &lsquo;localization &acute; recursion&rsquo; yields new ramifying paths and in doing so broadens the scope of navigation&mdash;that is to say, the constructive passage from the local to the global. An intuitive way to understand the procedure involved with recursive localization and its imports is as follows: Think of the planet Earth. When we are standing on the surface of the planet, we are occupying a location on its geodetic surface. From a local perspective, the geodetic surface appears to be flat and not curved. While occupying this point on the surface, if we ask &lsquo;where is the earth?&rsquo;, because of our immediate access to this local point where the global properties are perceived differently (i.e. locally), we would say the earth is a fixed sphere, we might even say it is just a flat surface. However, if we launch a perspective operator &ndash; a satellite &ndash; into the orbit and take pictures of the planet, upon compiling and integrating these pictures we will notice that the planet is fully mobile and it is spheroid. However, if we repeat this procedure from a broader neighborhood and take new orbital portraits or maps of the planet, then we will observe that not only is Earth spheroid, but also it is located within a celestial system held together by the gravitational force. This is a very intuitive and rather trivial understanding of how the product of localization and recursion works: By localizing the horizon and by way of reverse-engineering it from its orbit (i.e. possibilities of reorientation), rather than from its local fixed coordinates (i.e. information readily available by occupying a local section of it), recursive localization identifies the local horizon according to the site wherein it subsists. But from the perspective of recursive localization, the site is nothing but a cascade of ramifying paths and addresses. It is in the wake of these ramifying paths that the characterization of the local, its problems, imports and implications become a matter of navigation &ndash; that is to say, analysis and synthesis, remapping and reorientation, revision and construction.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2 c0"><a href="#ftnt24" id="ftnt_ref24">[24]</a></sup></p><p class="c4 c15"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c5 c2">Recursive Localization becomes a process of &ldquo;ramification&rdquo; and &ldquo;navigation&rdquo;. Through identifying the horizon of my locale, one is able to &ldquo;reverse engineer&rdquo; the pathways possible from my address of the setting (i.e. from the restricted and bounded information of a local site) and identify more and more global contexts and addresses to conceptualize my locale. </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2">A good example, as Negarestani says in a video, is the Mobius Strip, which locally appears one way but globally another (it has only one side).</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;Another example would be a &ldquo;torus&rdquo;, where locally, the surface appears to resemble the space of R</span><span class="c2 c33">2 </span><span class="c2">the real number system, but if we zoom out, it actually appears to be a donut, which has certain homological properties different than a sphere (i.e. it has a &ldquo;hole&rdquo;). &ldquo;The Poincare-Hopf Theorem relates local behavior of some differentiable object, namely </span><span class="c8 c2 c23">C</span><span class="c2 c11 c26 c33">&infin;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;vector fields, to the global topological structure of the manifold.

If one were to abide by classical notions of subjectivity, one would be still living in the paradigm of a &ldquo;flat earth&rdquo; because of tyranny of a fixed point. The epistemology that is restricted to a local domain and abuses this framework is also the culprit behind why humans thought the universe was geocentric (as opposed to heliocentric) because there was not enough information from a more universal context. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2 c10">Minimal Metaphysics</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10 c2"></span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;In genetic epistemology, as in developmental psychology, too, there is never an absolute beginning.

We immediately get into the realm of the coordinations within the nervous system and the neuron network, as discussed by McCulloch and Pitts. And then, if we look for the roots of the logic of the nervous system as discussed by these workers, we have to go back a step further. We find more basic organic coordinations. If we go further still into the realm of comparative biology, we find structures of inclusion ordering correspondence everywhere. I do not intend to go into biology; I just want to carry this regressive analysis back to its beginnings in psychology and to emphasise again that the formation of logical and mathematical structures in human thinking cannot be explained by language alone, but has its roots in the general coordination of actions.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2 c0"><a href="#ftnt27" id="ftnt_ref27">[27]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c5 c2">Jean Piaget was a structuralist psychologist who had even once spoken with Dieudonne of the Bourbaki mathematicians. Piaget makes the argument that language cannot be the autonomous building block for logical and mathematical structures (see quote above). Piaget notices that children learn about basic notions of commutativity when counting pebbles. Children realize that when they count pebbles one way or another way, they get the same result. This is a basic mathematical property known as commutativity where a + b = b + a. The equation is the same whether you add a first or if you add b first. Piaget says in his Genetic Epistemology that it is with children that we have the best chance of &ldquo;studying the development&rdquo; of logic. &ldquo;Since this field of biogenesis is not available to us, we shall do as biologists do and turn to ontogenesis. Nothing could be more accessible to study than the ontogenesis of these notions. There are children all around us. It is with children that we have the best chance of studying the development of logical knowledge, mathematical knowledge, physical knowledge, and so forth.&rdquo; But Piaget even suggests further, that as soon as we locate some beginning of logic, we have to go back even further to biology and the development of biological structure. Piaget espouses a philosophy similar to Gilbert Simondon&rsquo;s idea of individuation (which we will discuss in the next section). As soon as we locate some individual element, we are already too late because the process of individuation/ontogenesis has already occurred. We can trace this reasoning back to the idea that the universe that we live in consisting of discrete elements goes back to a previous universe of continuous protoplasm. Genetic epistemology has no &ldquo;absolute beginning&rdquo;.

But when I try to understand how the world works, I sense that there is a continuous basis upon which all things unfold in a more or less discrete fashion.

I realize of course that the standard model in contemporary mathematics is based on the definition of number given by Dedekind, by what are called Dedekind cuts. This makes it possible, in theory, to construct continuity directly out of arithmetic, that is to say, on the basis of the discontinuous. However, this process is in reality highly nonconstructive. It amounts to saying: The real numbers can be constructed by taking rational numbers and bringing them indefinitely close to one another. Then if one makes a cut, that is to say, a division of the rationals into two classes, in such a way that each rational in the first class is less than each rational in the second class, (with the understanding that the differences between them approaches zero), this can be taken as the definition of a real number. It&rsquo;s the traditional method for making Gruy&egrave;re cheese*: You take some holes and start building the cheese around them. There isn&rsquo;t very much cheese but there are lots of holes! Finally one ends up with no cheese at all, only holes! How is it possible, with nothing but holes, to fabricate a continuous and homogeneous paste? I must admit that it goes beyond me &hellip; The origins of all scientific thought can be situated in the paradoxes of Zeno of Elia: notably the story of Achilles and the tortoise. In it, one finds the fundamental opposition between the continuous and the discontinuous.&ldquo;</span><sup class="c2 c0"><a href="#ftnt28" id="ftnt_ref28">[28]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2">In a later section, contrary to Santiago Ram&oacute;n y Cajal, &nbsp;it will be shown that perception is continuous through the research of Jean Petitot and that vision requires a geometric ideality which Petitot calls &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">neurogeometry</span><span class="c5 c2">&rdquo; (or &ldquo;neurophysics&rdquo; if you like) and which can be observed experimentally at the level of neurons. I agree with Thom that the discrete is born out of the continuous. But as Thom describes the typical construction of the real numbers, the Dedekind cut, is the other way around (the continuous out of the discrete). The Dedekind cut uses two sets in order to construct an irrational number. The definition is as follows: </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c7 c2 c0">Suppose that we already know about some real number x. </span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c2 c0">When we could define a pair of sets (A</span><span class="c2 c27 c0">x</span><span class="c2 c0">, B</span><span class="c2 c27 c0">x</span><span class="c7 c2 c0">), where</span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c2 c0">- A</span><span class="c2 c27 c0">x</span><span class="c7 c2 c0">&nbsp;is the set of all rational numbers y such that y &lt; x, and </span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c2 c0">-B</span><span class="c2 c0 c27">x</span><span class="c7 c2 c0">&nbsp;is the set of all rational numbers y such that y &gt; x. </span></p><p class="c4 c15"><span class="c7 c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c2 c0">The way to think about this is that you are cutting the number line by an infinitely thin knife, at x, and Ax is all the numbers to the left of the knife and B</span><span class="c2 c27 c0">x</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;is all the numbers to the right.

However, the problem with this definition is that it depends on us already knowing about the number x. The idea behind Dedekind cuts is to just work with the pairs (A, B), without direct reference to any real number.

Thom was most famous for his construction of &lsquo;cobordism&rsquo; which was an equivalence relation between two manifolds based upon the boundary operator. The boundary operator can be thought of abiding by a similar logic to a derivative. Thom&rsquo;s greatest influence in the applied sciences may be his coinage of the term &lsquo;attractor&rsquo;. The &lsquo;basin of attractors&#39; is technically defined as open neighborhoods when </span><span class="c2">t approaches</span><span class="c5 c2">&nbsp;infinity for the phase space. A neighborhood is a basic definition within topology, in order to articulate notions such as &lsquo;limit points&rsquo; and rigorously defines the notion of closeness through the use of open sets. Open sets are the fundamental basis of topology, which we can even generalize to the cases of sheaves and Grothendieck topologies (discussed in the last section). If we are really to define some &ldquo;minimal metaphysics&rdquo; we would need to re-examine the notion of Time as continuously running in the manner of the real number. To make sense of the real numbers, and therefore time, we could arrive at some topological properties. The real numbers are a &ldquo;connected&rdquo; interval. Moreover, the infinity utilized in the real numbers is an uncountable infinity. Time as the real number system is therefore time as a continuous backdrop. Should we accept this continuum of time which is used in any system (dynamical or even not dynamical)?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c5 c2">Moreover, central to notions of topology are morphisms known as homeomorphism, which is a continuous bijection between two topological spaces. Discreteness can be thought of topological manifolds which have &ldquo;holes&rdquo; (for example, the torus has one hole). While continuity can be thought, in the study of differential geometry, as a diffeomorphism between two manifolds. Thom argues topology, in catastrophe theory, can be a method of making qualitative analysis of data based on regional discontinuities, such as a jump (as was discussed in the last section). These discontinuities, or singularities, can be studied through the method of analytic continuation (which is the means of expressing the Riemann Hypothesis for example). Through analytic continuation we are able to articulate the inaccessible region of the cusp catastrophe (as pictured below): &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 488.64px; height: 574.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.png" style="width: 488.64px; height: 574.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2">The genius of Thom&rsquo;s metaphysics was to theorize the monism of body and soul through a geometric object.

(Other examples of a mathematical process include the Process which abide by Markov chains, such as stochastic processes). For Thom, morphogenesis is ontologized biology; ontogenesis is ontologized structuralism. </span><span class="c5 c2">Rene Thom goes on to say:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Modern science has made the mistake of foregoing all ontology by reducing the criteria of truth to pragmatic success.

Pragmatism, in a way, is hardly more than the conceptualized form of a certain return to animal nature. Positivism battened on the fear of ontological involvement. But as soon as we recognize the existence of others and accept a dialogue with them, we are in fact ontologically involved. Why, then, should we not accept the entities suggested to us by language? Even though we would have to keep a check on abusive hypostasis, this seems the only way to bring a certain intelligibility to our environment. Only some realist metaphysics can give back meaning to this world of ours.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt32" id="ftnt_ref32">[32]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2">It seems that we should consider that entities imply &ldquo;ontological involvement&rdquo;, even linguistic entities, in order to ascribe intelligibility to the world. And Thom is saying that meaning exists through a &ldquo;realist metaphysics&rdquo;. In my Twitter interaction with Negarestani, Negarestani has commented upon this Thom quote, saying: &ldquo;Thom was a great mathematician but he himself mistook metaphysical theses with epistemical ones. This is why his name now in math and biology societies equals the patient zero of charlatanism.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt33" id="ftnt_ref33">[33]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;In order to be sure we are not hypostatizing an ontology which is supported by theology or some abusive axiom, I would suggest that our minimal metaphysics be &ldquo;de-ontologized&rdquo; in the manner of Laruelle&rsquo;s realism, which I will discuss in a later section on eliminativism. But the question then remains if we are of the realism camp or eliminative camp. I would argue that we accept &ldquo;ontic structural realism&rdquo; while simultaneously deriving a &ldquo;topological hermeneutics&rdquo; that is analogical in order to ascribe intelligibility to the world, but the necessity of such a metaphysics need be suspended. So the </span><span class="c2 c23">real</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;first cause would not be Aristotelian realism of structure, even though physics is real and as a structure is ontic (i.e. there is an &ldquo;a priori&rdquo; on the level of relativity: light is absolute), but rather the real cause of ontology is the ineffability of the Real which can not be philosophized and can only be hypothesized in the manner of topos and Grothendieck universes which require the Tarski axiom. But even with this ontology, Negarestani has said we need to be careful: &ldquo;Zalamea is a gentleman. But is this enough? Is this what we actually want: a sheaf of romantic vagaries where all math fields become the expressions of the sublime?

Rene Thom is arguing for some minimal metaphysics. But we can, in a </span><span class="c2">eliminativist</span><span class="c5 c2">&nbsp;way, desublimate/de-ontologize this metaphysics for the purposes of a hermeneutics (of logic, of a formal system, of physics) and treat any &ldquo;ontological involvement&rdquo; as merely an axiom which we do not need to invoke (e.g. Andrew Wiles&rsquo; non-usage of Grothendieck universes)! Through the axiomatic approach of topos theory, one is able to conceive of arithmetic or number as inherently geometric or form. We will discuss this breakthrough in the work of Alain Connes in a later section, whose work in non-commutative geometry (mathematical physics) has been shown as means of expressing quantum field theory (theoretical physics). Is mathematics the hermeneutics of physics? The more challenging question remains if we should accept the ontology of physics; that is do we accept that physical entities really do exist?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c34 c2 c26">Individuation of </span><span class="c34 c2 c23 c26">potentia</span><span class="c10 c2">&nbsp;within a metastable system (Gilbert Simondon)</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c24 c2 c37"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2">If we are to follow the thinking of Piaget who said there is no &ldquo;absolute beginning&rdquo; then we must consider the father of this thinking of individuation: Gilbert Simondon.

The principle of individuation, then, is not grasped at the point where individuation itself occurs as a process, but in that which the operation requires before it can exist, that is, a matter and a form. Here the principle is thought to be contained either in the matter or the form, because the actual process of individuation is not thought to be capable of furnishing the principle itself, but simply of putting it into effect. Thus, the search for the principle of individuation is undertaken either before or after individuation has taken place, according to whether the model of the individual being used is a physical one (as in substantialist atomism) or a technological and vital one (as in hylomorphic theory). In both of these cases, though, there remains a region of uncertainty when it comes to dealing with the process of individuation, for this process is seen as something that needs to be explained, rather than as something in which the explanation is to be found: whence the notion of a principle of individuation. Now, if this process is considered as something to be explained, this is because the received way of thinking is always oriented toward the successfully individuated being, which it then seeks to account for, bypassing the stage where individuation takes place, in order to reach the individual that is the result of this process. In consequence, an assumption is made that events follow a certain chronology: first, the principle of individuation; then, this principle at work in a process that results in individuation; and finally, the emergence of the constituted individual. On the other hand, though, were we able to see that in the process of individuation other things were produced besides the individual, there would be no such attempt to hurry past the stage where individuation takes place in order to arrive at the ultimate reality that is the individual. Instead , we would try to grasp the entire unfolding of ontogenesis in all its variety, and to understand the individual from the perspective of the process of individuation rather than the process of individuation by means of the individual&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2">Deleuze was particularly influenced by Simondon and Simondon&rsquo;s &ldquo;pre-individual fields&rdquo;. Deleuze utilized this idea in his articulation of becoming-actual out of the virtual. Simondon argues that an atomist metaphysics is wrong for attempting to locate the origin of structure in the individual atom. For the atomistic individual takes place after the process of individuation has already occurred. Instead, there is a pre-individual field from which the atom was individuated. We can turn to Sir Michael Atiyah&rsquo;s explanation of this problem whereby our world of the discrete (atoms) was individuated from protoplasm.</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt36" id="ftnt_ref36">[36]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;Similarly the Aristotelian hylomorphic theory is wrong for attempting to locate the origin before individuation in the metaphysical notions of &ldquo;matter&rdquo; and &ldquo;form&rdquo; which individuation puts into place. Simondon makes the argument that we should make the principle of individuation itself the explanation for individual elements.

Refer to Deleuze&rsquo;s fifth chapter of Difference &amp; Repetition: &ldquo;&ldquo;The Asymmetrical Synthesis of the Sensible.&rdquo; For Simondon, one can think of individuation as the process by which a metastable system, with a multiplicity of potential states, stabilizes. </span></p><p class="c17"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 273.00px; height: 227.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image12.png" style="width: 273.00px; height: 227.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2">This </span><span class="c2 c23">potentia</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is the wellspring from which the conatus actualizes.

This relation between states is completely non-thetic. The system is an immanent system which resolves (unlike the Hegelian dialectic) by way of its own metastability. Central to Simondon (and Deleuze) is the notion of the &ldquo;singularity&rdquo; of the thing, which can be thought of as the specificity of the thing. Gilbert Simondon writes:</span></p><p class="c4 c15"><span class="c7 c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;To a certain extent, the idea of a principle of individuation has been derived from a genesis that works backward, an ontogenesis &quot;in reverse,&quot; because in order to account for the genesis of the individual and its defining characteristics one must assume the existence of a first term, a principle, which would provide a sufficient explanation of how the individual had come to be individual and account for its singularity (haecceity) - but this does not prove that the essential precondition of ontogenesis need be anything resembling a first term. Yet a term is itself already an individual, or at least something capable of being individualized, something that can be the cause of an absolutely specific existence (haecceity), something that can lead to a proliferation of many new </span><span class="c2 c0">haecceities</span><span class="c7 c2 c0">. Anything that contributes to establishing relations already belongs to the same mode of existence as the individual, whether it be an atom, which is an indivisible and eternal particle, or prime matter, or a form. The atom interacts with other atoms through the clinamen, and in this way it can constitute an individual (though not always a viable one) across the entire expanse of the void and the whole of endless becoming. Matter can be impressed with a form , and the source of ontogenesis can be derived from this matter-form relation. Indeed, if haecceities were not somehow inherent within the atom, or matter, or indeed form, it would be impossible to find a principle of individuation in any of the above-mentioned realities. To seek the principle individuation in something that preexists this same individuation is tantamount to reducing individuation to nothing more than ontogenesis. The principle of individuation here is the source of haecceity.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c24 c2 c16"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2">Haeccity for Simondon is to be found in the principle of individuation itself and ontogenesis cannot be merely reduced to a metaphysical atomism. It is through the individuation of the cell that the cell acquires its unique singularity. It is through individuation that the work of art acquires its aura. It is through individuation, through becoming (in the Deluzian sense), that the actual becomes manifest from the wellspring of the virtual. &nbsp;For Deleuze, this actualization (</span><span class="c2">differenCiation</span><span class="c2">) is based upon the realm of virtuality (differenTiation), pre-individual singularities of the Idea. The latter is defined in the fourth chapter of Difference &amp; Repetition and the former in the fifth chapter. The Idea is defined as the &ldquo;relations of the universal&rdquo; - difference-in-itself. The &ldquo;a priori&rdquo; for Deleuze is the &ldquo;pure past,&rdquo; that pre-exists the empirical present and is transcendental and metaphysical (in the pre-individual Idea), which then the third synthesis makes extensive and expresses (i.e. </span><span class="c2">differenCiation</span><span class="c2">) through its &rdquo;correspondence&rdquo; (unification) between present, &ldquo;larval subject&rdquo; (&ldquo;empirical ground&rdquo;) and </span><span class="c2">undifferenciated</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Idea of &ldquo;pure past&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt39" id="ftnt_ref39">[39]</a></sup><span class="c5 c2">: </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c2 c0">However, actualization happens as individuating difference is the determination of differentiation in the Idea, and not specification in the concept. So determination must be distinguished from specification and Idea from conceptuality. How so? Determination is to be understood as the distinction in the Idea as the pure virtual realm, whereas specification in concepts already refers to given differentiated concepts. The Idea as pure virtual is non-conceptual </span><span class="c2 c0">difference in</span><span class="c2 c0">-itself, insofar as it is merely latent in the whole, not already specified by conceptual identity. Thus actualization achieves an individuated difference by determining an immanent difference in the Idea. Determination in actualization determines a) extrinsic difference of instances contracted in the present and b) the intrinsic difference between degrees of contraction in memory; the difference between present and past is determined as the difference between extensive repetition related to successive instants (living present of habit, expressing thought or larval subject) and intensive repetition of co-existing levels in the past (past as whole, contraction of time (pure past) by space / dilution of space by time (pure past) / expressed Idea of the virtual </span><span class="c2 c0">undifferenciated</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;being). (Deleuze 1968: 114, 1994: 84). It is a third synthesis of these two moments, as expressing and expressed which guarantees their correspondence, and their unitary being. Thought determines in the passivity of the larval subject (present as contracted past, empirical ground), the Idea is </span><span class="c2 c0">undifferenciated</span><span class="c7 c2 c0">&nbsp;being (pure past as transcendental/metaphysical ground); between them is the pure empty form of time which transcendentally guarantees that the indeterminate (Idea) can become determinate (Deleuze 1968: 220, 1994: 169). This is a purely logical, non-chronological time void of empirical content (living present of habit) or metaphysical substance (contractions/dilations of ontological memory) and guaranteeing the correspondence between thinking and being, expressing and expressed. Brassier writes:</span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Accordingly, it establishes the correlation between the determination of thought as individuating difference borne by the intensive thinker, and the determinability of being as differentiated but </span><span class="c2 c0">undifferenciated</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;pre-individual realm.

The symbol which expresses it is therefore completely undetermined: dx is strictly nothing in relation to x, as dy is in relation to y.</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;The whole problem, however, lies in the signification of these zeros. Quanta as objects of intuition always have particular values; and even when they are united in a fractional relation, each maintains a value independently of the relation. As a concept of the understanding, quantitas has a general value; generality here </span><span class="c2 c0">referring</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;to an infinity of possible particular values: as many as the variable can assume. However, there must always be a particular value charged with representing the others, and with standing for them: this is the case with the algebraic equation for the circle, X</span><span class="c2 c0 c33">2</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;+ Y</span><span class="c2 c0 c33">2</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;- R</span><span class="c2 c0 c33">2 </span><span class="c2 c0">= 0. The same does not hold for ydy + xdx = 0, which signifies &#39;the universal of the circumference or of the corresponding function&#39;. The zeros involved in dx and dy express the annihilation of the quantum and the quantitas, of the general as well as the particular, in favour of &#39;the universal and its appearance&#39;. The force of the interpretation given by Bordas-Demoulin is as follows: it is not the differential quantities which are cancelled in dy/dx or 0/0 but rather the individual and the individual relations within the function (by &#39;individual&#39;, Bordas means both the particular and the general). We have passed from one genus to another, as if to the other side of the mirror: having lost its mutable part or the property of variation, the function represents only the immutable along with the operation which uncovered it. That which is cancelled changes in it, and in being cancelled allows a glimpse </span><span class="c2 c0">beyond of that</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;which does not change. In short, the limit must be conceived not as the limit of a function but as a genuine cut [coupure], a border between the changeable and the unchangeable within the function itself. Newton&#39;s mistake, therefore, is that of making the differentials equal to zero, while Leibniz&#39;s mistake is to identify them with the individual or with variability</span><span class="c2 c21 c0">. In this respect, Bordas is already close to the modern interpretation of calculus: the limit no longer presupposes the ideas of a continuous variable and infinite approximation. On the contrary, the notion of limit grounds a new, static and purely ideal definition of continuity, while its own definition implies no more than number, or rather, the universal in number. Modern mathematics then specifies the nature of this universal of number as consisting in the &#39;cut&#39; (in the sense of </span><span class="c2 c21 c0 c34">Dedekind</span><span class="c2 c21 c0">): in this sense, it is the cut which constitutes the next genus of number, the ideal cause of continuity or the pure element of </span><span class="c2 c21 c0">quantitability</span><span class="c2 c21 c0">.</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c21 c0">In relation to x, dx is completely undetermined, as dy is to y, but they are perfectly determinable in relation to one another. For this reason, a principle of determinability corresponds to the undetermined as such. The universal is not a nothing since there are, in Bordas&#39;s expression, &#39;relations of the universal&#39;. dx and dy are completely </span><span class="c2 c21 c0">undifferenciated</span><span class="c2 c21 c0">&nbsp;[indifferencies], in the particular and in the general, but completely differentiated [differenties] in and by the universal.</span><sup class="c2 c21 c0"><a href="#ftnt44" id="ftnt_ref44">[44]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2">At Deleuze&rsquo;s heart, he has an idealism in defining both the differential unconscious of (the pure past) and the &lsquo;fractured I&rsquo; (of the future) upon the ideal &ldquo;static&rdquo; continuous number which is, the &ldquo;universal in number&rdquo; - not to be thought of as individual elements but rather the &ldquo;relations of the </span><span class="c2">universal&rdquo;</span><span class="c2">, i.e. pure differentials.

We would also argue that Heidegger&rsquo;s time is too idealist and his metaphysics of time is non-existent according </span><span class="c2">to the physical</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;reality. The problem of his ontology is to found a temporality upon purely psychological notions. Jean Wahl had criticized Heidegger for trying to create a &ldquo;Nunc Stans&rdquo; through a unification of his three ekstaces of time (falleness, thrownness and projection). &nbsp;Space and time can be only experienced through the embodied vectors of ct and x. The ramifications this has for epistemology are tremendous. Our finite world is too small to exemplify these macro structures, but they really do exist once we are at that scale and are exemplified in a completely &ldquo;in situ&rdquo; manner. Therefore the only means of comparing two spaceships traveling at different speeds would be to compare their respective vectors to the speed of light. Light is the only absolute. In this sense, there is an a priori faktum, namely the absolute which is the speed of light. The hyperbolic geometry, whether the Klein model or Poincare half plane, usually has an absolute which is the &ldquo;point at infinity.&rdquo; For the Minkowski model, the speed of light is taken to be this absolute. But on a micro- or meso- level can we conceive of a parameterized time as we have in the past section where we discuss Rene Thom. Aristotle viewed time as a series of &lsquo;now-points&rsquo;. Is not the axis of time equivalent to the real number line? In the case of the stock market, we have a stochastic process which is unfolding in a continuous way.

He has said van Fraassen asks whether or not electrons really do exist. From my own conversations with a matematician, I have gleaned that two electrons are identical, but no two protons are identical. Can we make claims about the identity of two things, if we are not even allowed this relation of identity?

We leave these questions of the existence of physical entities to philosophers of science and we will choose to focus instead on the questions of structure (its epistemology and ontology) in the philosophy of mathematics.

At this point, it was taken as self-evident that there was an unavoidable scission between phenomenology (being as it appears to us in the perceived world and the cognitive faculties that process it) and physics (the objective being of the material world). However, we may say that it is not so much self-evident as a straightforward prejudice. In any case, this disjunction transformed the perceived world into a world of subjective-relative appearances&mdash;mental projections&mdash;with no objective content and belonging to psychology. Beyond psychology, the most that could be attributed to these appearances in the way of objectivity was a logical form of objectivity to be found in the theories of meaning and mental contents, from Bolzano and Frege, Husserl and Russell, to contemporary analytical philosophy.

The fields studying perception were taken to be too subjective and were deemed &ldquo;psychology&rdquo; and could only achieve some objectivity within the fields of logic and analytic philosophy. Similarly, the field of physics could not explain the perceived world as was immediate to us and could only explain situations on either a macro-scale or at the most fundamental level. Petitot argues that this division between phenomenology and physics is a prejudice. &nbsp;Petitot constructs a theoretical computational machine which uses &lambda;-calculus for the operation of &ldquo;neural hardware&rdquo; and differential geometry for the operations of &ldquo;geometric software.&rdquo; Petitot shows that V1 neurons have been experimentally demonstrated to construct a &ldquo;cut locus&rdquo; (from differential geometry) through brain imaging. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17 c2 c15"><span class="c7 c2 c0">&ldquo;Our last example concerns the cut locus of a figure, also called the generalized symmetry axis or &lsquo;skeleton&rsquo;.

Once again, imaging can show us the neural reality of the construction of this inner skeleton, for which there is no trace whatever in the sensory input, the latter consisting merely of an outer contour. Figures 2.6 and 2.7, produced by David Mumford&rsquo;s disciple Tai Sing Lee, illustrate the response of a population of simple V1 neurons, whose preferred orientation is vertical, to textures with edges specified by opposing orientations. Up to around 80&ndash;100 ms, the early response involves only the local orientation of the stimulus. Between 100 and 300 ms, the response concerns the overall perceptual structure and the cut locus appears.

One need only examine the texture strip and the corresponding spatiotemporal response pictured in Fig 2.6 to see how this geometry is completely immanent to the subject. </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c5 c2">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c34 c2 c26">The eliminative structuralism whereby structure is a &ldquo;shorthand&rdquo; &nbsp;for different isomorphic systems which share patterns</span><sup class="c34 c2 c26"><a href="#ftnt54" id="ftnt_ref54">[54]</a></sup><span class="c10 c2">; the complementarity of &lsquo;axiom&rsquo; and &lsquo;theorem&rsquo;; eliminative structuralism of regimented propositions that have been de-ontologized. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c24 c2 c16"></span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Another option is to deny that structures exist at all.

Yoneda Lemma is a phenomenologically trivial tool, but it nevertheless possesses a formidable power to reverse-engineer local concepts by way of their neighbourhood, by way of their outside. A point is nothing but the pointer that points to it. The actual mark is a pointer endowed with a limit, just like the mark that the tip of a pencil leaves on a piece of paper. Once the point is understood as a pointer, the concept of point can be made via an infinite recursive descent: A point is a point is a point is a point &hellip; ad infinitum. 8 Each pointer can be decomposed to a concatenation of different sets of pointers or addresses. The concept of the point is nothing but an alternating collection of gestural/perspectival pointers (arrows or morphisms). There is indeed a functionalist underside to this definition of the concept qua a local site: If what makes a thing a thing is not what a thing is but what a thing does, then we can decompose this activity or behavior (the behavior of the concept) into operative perspectives or possible activities that make the behavior of the concept in an inferential network. The study of the concept and its construction overlap, as they become part of a controlled exploratory approach.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2 c0"><a href="#ftnt56" id="ftnt_ref56">[56]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c5 c2">While Negarestani seems to indicate that structure is merely shorthand for the isomorphic systems. Negarestani, as his recent work Intelligence &amp; Spirit confirms, seems to actually be more of a functionalist than an eliminativist. One can think of the quintessential functionalist Hilary Putnum who said that mind was a Turing machine. The key import of the Yoneda limit for Negarestani is the functional decomposition of the morphisms into &ldquo;the behavior of the concept&rdquo; within an &ldquo;inferential network&rdquo;, i.e. not what the concept is, but &ldquo;what a thing does&rdquo;. In order to differentiate these two schools from one another (eliminative structuralism and functionalism) we will examine a more precise definition of the former:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c7 c2 c0">&ldquo;The eliminativist holds that mathematical statements just are (or are best interpreted as) generalizations like these and she accuses the [Sui Generis] structuralist of making too much of their surface grammar, trying to draw deep metaphysical conclusions from that.

For Laruelle, his non-philosophy is a means of suspending the transcendence (the &ldquo;metaphysical conclusions&rdquo; mentioned above) of any philosophical system and arriving at a transcendental which consists of the duality between &lsquo;axiom&rsquo; and &lsquo;theorem&rsquo;. For example, if Laruelle were to Deleuze&rsquo;s philosophy, this duality would be the pair of &lsquo;actual&rsquo; and the &lsquo;virtual&rsquo; taken together. This in effect, de-ontologizes the view from the &lsquo;plane of immanence&rsquo; which supposedly lives in the realm of virtuality (as we discussed before, this is an idealist transcendence since Deleuze&rsquo;s third synthesis is based on the Dedekind cut). Laruelle&rsquo;s radical immanence is a means for performative philosophy which is in favor of material experimentation (the derived &ldquo;a priori&rdquo; of the unilateral duality which takes the </span><span class="c2">non-philosophizable</span><span class="c5 c2">&nbsp;Real as its condition) as opposed to Deleuze&rsquo;s plane of immanence (which has a formal a priori, namely the process of differentiation described in his fourth chapter of Difference &amp; Repetition).</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c5 c2">But there still remains a problem of eliminative structuralism.

Bourbaki continues on to answer their own question about the unity of mathematics: </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c2 c0">After the more or less evident bankruptcy of the different systems, to which we have referred above, it looked, at the beginning of the present century as if the attempt had just about been abandoned to conceive of mathematics as a science characterized by a definitely specified purpose and method; instead there was a tendency to look upon mathematics as &ldquo;a collection of disciplines based on particular, exactly specified concepts,&rdquo; interrelated by &ldquo;a thousand roads of communication,&rdquo; allowing the methods of any one of these disciplines to fertilize one or more of the others [1, page 447]. Today, we believe however that the internal evolution of mathematical science has, in spite of appearance, brought about a closer unity among its different parts, so as to create something like a central nucleus that is more coherent than it has ever been. The essential aspect of this evolution has been the systematic study of the relations existing between different mathematical theories, and which has led to what is generally known as the &ldquo;axiomatic method.</span><sup class="c2 c0"><a href="#ftnt64" id="ftnt_ref64">[64]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c5 c2">The axiomatic method of Bourbaki was in the tradition of David Hilbert&rsquo;s axiomatic program.

If a glass comes towards you, you can walk backwards in such a way that the glass seems unaltered. You can do the same if it tilts or rotates. The mind comes to contain a store of these compensating motions, and it realises that it can follow one with another and the result will be a third compensating motion. These mental acts form a mathematical object called a group. However, the mind cannot generate compensating motions for other motions it sees, such as the motion of the wine in the glass as it swirls around. In this way the mind comes to form the concept of a rigid body motion, that being precisely the motion for which the mind can form a compensating motion.</span></p><p class="c4 c15"><span class="c7 c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c7 c2 c0">Poincar&eacute; then considered what group the group of compensating motions could be, and found that, as Helmholtz had suggested and Lie had then proved, there was a strictly limited collection of such groups.

But which one was correct?</span></p><p class="c4 c15"><span class="c7 c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c2 c0">Poincar&eacute;&rsquo;s controversial view was that one could never know.

If we met such a species, there would be no experiment that would decide the issue...This twist on the Kantian doctrine of the unknowability of the Ding an sich (the thing in itself) and our confinement to the world of appearances, was congenial to Poincar&eacute; as a working physicist, but there is an important distinction to make. The viewpoint just explained is Poincar&eacute;&rsquo;s philosophy of geometrical conventionalism. He advocated conventionalism in other areas of science, arguing that what we call the laws of nature (Newton&rsquo;s laws, the conservation of energy, and so forth) were neither empirical matters open to revision nor absolute truths but were well established results that had been elevated to the role of axioms in present scientific theories. They could be challenged, but only if a whole scientific theory was being challenged, not idly when some awkward observations were made. Faced with a satellite that did not seem to be obeying Newton&rsquo;s laws one should, said Poincar&eacute;, consider some as-yet unnoticed force at work and not seek to </span><span class="c2 c0">re-write</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;Newton. But a new theory can be proposed, based on different assumptions that rewrite a law of nature, because these laws are not eternal truths&mdash;we could never know such things.

This </span><span class="c2">equiconsistency</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;at, not only the mathematical level, but also the epistemological level, should lead us to consider the fundamental import of Felix Klein&rsquo;s Erlangen Programme. Klein&rsquo;s programme for geometry was to first unify all geometries through projective geometry. But secondly and more importantly, &ldquo;Klein proposed that group theory, a branch of mathematics that uses algebraic methods to abstract the idea of symmetry, was the most useful way of organizing geometrical knowledge; at the time it had already been introduced into the theory of equations in the form of Galois theory.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt70" id="ftnt_ref70">[70]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;The only formula that proves to be invariant in each respective space (through Mobius transformation) within the respective geometries of hyperbolic, Euclidean or spherical is &ldquo;cross ratio&rdquo;.

Following Gauss&rsquo; Theorema Egregium, this method provides a means by which the intrinsic invariants of material are central (de-ontologized metaphysics) as opposed to the extrinsic objectivation of the thing in an embedded space (pre-ontology). But as Petitot has pointed out: does embedded space exist without neural networks? Moreover, according to Poincare&rsquo;s epistemology, we can think of the axiomatic method as a conventionalist approach which need not state anything ontological.

Because of its abstraction of specific algebraic structures to categories of objects which relate to one another through morphisms, category theory can be thought of as a philosophical structuralism:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c7 c2 c0">Two facets of the nature of mathematical objects within a categorical framework have to be emphasized. First, objects are always given in a category. An object exists in and depends upon an ambient category. Furthermore, an object is characterized by the morphisms going in it and/or the morphisms coming out of it. Second, objects are always characterized up to isomorphism (in the best cases, up to a unique isomorphism). There is no such thing, for instance, as the natural numbers. However, it can be argued that there is such a thing as the concept of natural numbers. Indeed, the concept of natural numbers can be given unambiguously, via the Dedekind-Peano-Lawvere axioms, but what this concept refers to in specific cases depends on the context in which it is interpreted, e.g., the category of sets or a topos of sheaves over a topological space. Thus, it seems that sense does not determine reference in a categorical context. It is hard to resist the temptation to think that category theory embodies a form of structuralism, that it describes mathematical objects as structures since the latter, presumably, are always characterized up to isomorphism. Thus, the key here has to do with the kind of criterion of identity at work within a categorical framework and how it resembles any criterion given for objects which are thought of as forms in general. One of the standard objections presented against this view is that if objects are thought of as structures and only as abstract structures, meaning here that they are separated from any specific or concrete representation, then it is impossible to locate them within the mathematical universe. (See Hellman 2003 for a standard formulation of the objection, McLarty 1993, Awodey 2004, Landry &amp; Marquis 2005, Shapiro 2005, Landry 2011, Linnebo &amp; Pettigrew 2011, Hellman 2011, Shapiro 2011, McLarty 2011, Logan 2015 for relevant material on the issue.)</span></p><p class="c4 c15"><span class="c7 c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2">Category theory can be thought of as a means to instantiate varying algebraic structures through either the category of sets, the category of groups, the category of rings, the category of topological spaces, etc. The only thing that is &ldquo;positive&rdquo; is the morphisms which relate objects within these categories, which can be thought of as the structural relations between objects. The interiors of the objects are not necessary! &ldquo;What is remarkable about this apparatus is that the vast bulk of structures arising in mathematics can be captured in the spare language of &lsquo;arrows only,&rsquo; without &lsquo;looking inside&rsquo; the objects (which, recall, are typically whole structures or spaces e.g. algebraic, metric, topological, etc.).&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt73" id="ftnt_ref73">[73]</a></sup><span class="c5 c2">&nbsp;Typical set membership relationships need not be exemplified. Everything can be viewed from &ldquo;arrows only&rdquo; (morphisms) as is typically shown in commutative diagrams. But the problem with such generality is &ldquo;it is impossible to locate [objects as specific or concrete structures] within the mathematical universe&rdquo;. The solution to this dilemma is &ldquo;type theory&rdquo;:</span></p><p class="c4 c15"><span class="c7 c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c2 c0">A slightly different way to make sense of the situation is to think of mathematical objects as types for which there are tokens given in different contexts. This is strikingly different from the situation one finds in set theory, in which mathematical objects are defined uniquely and their reference is given directly. Although one can make room for types within set theory via equivalence classes or isomorphism types in general, the basic criterion of identity within that framework is given by the axiom of extensionality and thus, ultimately, reference is made to specific sets. Furthermore, it can be argued that the relation between a type and its token is not represented adequately by the membership relation. A token does not belong to a type, it is not an element of a type, but rather it is an instance of it. In a categorical framework, one always refers to a token of a type, and what the theory characterizes directly is the type, not the tokens. In this framework, one does not have to locate a type, but tokens of it are, at least in mathematics, epistemologically required. This is simply the reflection of the interaction between the abstract and the concrete in the epistemological sense (and not the ontological sense of these latter expressions.)

A &ldquo;mathematical structuralism&rdquo; proper is obvious. The point made by Awodey is that category theory favors a top-down approach over the bottom-up foundationalist approach. A set theorist needs to define all of the necessary structures and axioms in order to do the usual mathematics, while the category theorist need not make a universal quantification over the universe of all possible structures. The category theorist can define the objects through morphisms and rather objects are an instance or type. For example, in order to define i</span><span class="c2 c33">2</span><span class="c2">=-1, the category theorist can say &quot;given any ring&quot; as opposed to defining the universe of all possible ring structures and fixing some given structure, such as the complex numbers. Awodey makes the argument that the category theorist is making a &quot;schematic statement about structure&quot;. This can be generalized to structures that are formally similar but not identical (the key to category theories premise of &quot;up to isomorphism&quot;) such that you have some set X such as X</span><span class="c2 c33">2</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;+ X + 1 = X, this is even general to any semi-ring since it need not require additive inverse. &nbsp; But schematic statements are not about universal quantification over some universe of, say, all possible semirings, or even not about some universal quantification, which usually requires the quantification to be restricted over a fixed domain. He uses the example of a fixed quantification of a value, such as for ALL REAL numbers x</span><span class="c2 c33">2</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;+ 1 is a real number VERSUS the indeterminate case, such as for a polynomial ring R[x] with real coefficients, where it can be proved that there does not exist a polynomial p(x) such that p(x)</span><span class="c2 c33">2</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;= x</span><span class="c2 c33">2</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;+ 1. &ldquo;In the case of the quantified statement, we consider what is true for an arbitrary real number, while in the indeterminate case we, in effect, consider what holds for an arbitrary number x, in an arbitrary ring over R. One could say, rather speculatively, that the difference in both cases seems to be related to that between what is true for all of a fixed range of values, as opposed to what can be proved for an indeterminate value.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt76" id="ftnt_ref76">[76]</a></sup><span class="c2">&nbsp;So when a theorem invokes &quot;a finitely generated abelian group&quot; it does not specify the elements of the group, so the statement is schematic in the sense </span><span class="c2">what</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;the structures &quot;consist of&quot; are &quot;undetermined&quot;. If one makes a statement relating a topological space such as </span><span class="c2 c21">S</span><span class="c2 c21 c33">1</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;to its covering space, </span><span class="c2 c21">R</span><span class="c2">, and defining the fundamental group through the fiber of </span><span class="c2 c21">S</span><span class="c2 c21 c33">1</span><span class="c2">, one is not necessarily defining what points are in the topological space, one is relating a group </span><span class="c2 c21">Z</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;to the cover </span><span class="c2 c21">R</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;based on an isomorphism between the index of the fiber and the integers (there are </span><span class="c2 c21">Z</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;elements stacked on top of each other). Awodey isn&#39;t arguing that category theory can provide an autonomous alternative to set theory for the foundations of mathematics. He doesn&#39;t think there will be some &quot;true topos,&quot; in which all of mathematics can be done. Rather he thinks category theory is the best to approach the modern approach of mathematics after Galois et al. &quot;in category theory, such notions as relation, connection, property, and operation are all subsumed under the primitive notion of a morphism.&quot; He rather thinks there needs to be a different interpretation of categorical mathematics, which after homotopy type theory, is the top-down approach. The top-down approach need not have to define where higher and higher levels come from: for example if one has some group G and then a category C and then one has Group(C) which is the category of all groups in that category. Everything is an instance or type and need not be presupposed to exist, what matters is the relations between objects (as Jean-Pierre Serre said). &quot;Thus rather than saying, for example, &ldquo;now suppose this particular solar system is an atom in some huge piece of matter in an enormous solar system&rdquo;, one is instead saying &ldquo;now suppose this particular configuration of bodies occurs, not as a solar system, but as an atom in some piece of matter in a solar system&rdquo;. The former assumption indeed requires additional (outrageous) existence assumptions, while the latter requires none. A configuration is only assumed as a structure from the start, and so it can be specialized by assuming it to occur in more special situations. The schematic character of statements about structures is clearly essential to this approach; whatever we were saying about C originally (e.g. that there is a group in it), can still be said about C after we have put it into some ambient category S, because we weren&rsquo;t assuming anything particular about it in the first place.&quot;</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt77" id="ftnt_ref77">[77]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c34 c2 c26">Topos theory; Homotopy Type Theory as a foundation for mathematics; </span><span class="c10 c2">the Tarski axiom and Grothendieck&rsquo;s universes; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c2 c0">Lawvere from early on promoted the idea that a category of categories could be used as a foundational framework. (See Lawvere 1964, 1966.) This proposal now rests in part on the development of higher-dimensional categories, also called weak n-categories. (See, for instance Makkai 1998.) The advent of topos theory in the seventies brought new possibilities. Mac Lane has suggested that certain toposes be considered as a genuine foundation for mathematics. (See Mac Lane 1986.) Lambek proposed the so-called free topos as the best possible framework, in the sense that mathematicians with different philosophical outlooks might nonetheless agree to adopt it. (See Couture &amp; Lambek 1991, 1992, Lambek 1994.) He has also argued that there </span><span class="c2 c0">is no</span><span class="c7 c2 c0">&nbsp;topos that can thoroughly satisfy a classical mathematician. (See Lambek 2004.)

It is safe to say that we now have a good understanding of what are called (&infin;,1)-categories and important mathematical results have been obtained in that framework. (See, for instance, Cisinski 2019 for a presentation.) An adequate language for the universe of arbitrary higher-dimensional categories still has to be presented together with definite axioms for mathematics. (See Makkai 1998 for a short description of such a language. A different approach based on homotopy theory but with closed connections with higher-dimensional categories has been proposed by Voevodsky et al. and is being vigorously pursued.

What are the ontological commitments of topos theory?

It is a non-conservative extension of Zermelo&ndash;Fraenkel set theory (ZFC) and is distinguished from other axiomatic set theories by the inclusion of Tarski&#39;s axiom, which states that for each set there is a Grothendieck universe it belongs to (see below). Tarski&#39;s axiom implies the existence of inaccessible cardinals, providing a richer ontology than that of conventional set theories such as ZFC. For example, adding this axiom supports category theory.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c2 c0"><a href="#ftnt80" id="ftnt_ref80">[80]</a></sup></p><p class="c4 c15"><span class="c5 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c5 c2">By way of the Tarski axiom, one is able to prove the consistency of ZFC. The Tarski axiom requires the existence of a Grothendieck universe for each set. But the Tarski axiom requires an inaccessible cardinal (i.e. size of infinity, Cantor was the first to formalize cardinality and countability) which is not provable within ZFC if ZFC is consistent. This axiom by way of the existence of such an uncountable cardinality, therefore makes an ontological commitment. Andrew Wiles, who proved Fermat&rsquo;s Last Theorem, makes use of much of Grothendieck&rsquo;s mathematics in his proof. I am not at a technical level to study his proof, but the question remains, does Wiles&rsquo; work, which makes use of etale cohomology require these uncountable universes? To answer this question, I defer to an expert:</span></p><p class="c4 c15"><span class="c7 c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c2 c22 c0">&quot;The basic contention here is that Wiles&#39; work uses cohomology of sheaves on certain Grothendieck topologies, the general theory of which was first developed in Grothendieck&#39;s </span><span class="c2 c22 c0">SGAIV</span><span class="c2 c22 c0">&nbsp;and which requires the existence of an uncountable Grothendieck universe. It has since been clarified that the existence of such a thing is equivalent to the existence of an inaccessible cardinal, and that this existence -- or even the consistency of the existence of an inaccessible cardinal! -- cannot be proved from ZFC alone, assuming that ZFC is consistent. Many working arithmetic and algebraic geometers however take it as an article of faith that in any use of Grothendieck cohomology theories to solve a &quot;reasonable problem&quot;, the appeal to the universe axiom can be bypassed. Doubtless this faith is predicated on abetted by the fact that most arithmetic and algebraic geometers (present company included) are not really conversant or willing to wade into the intricacies of set theory....&quot; And read this: &quot;As a result, in order to figure out if Wiles&#39;s proof uses universes, or whether it&#39;s relatively easy to avoid them, you&#39;d need to either read the proofs yourself or find someone who was both deeply familiar with the details of the proof, and someone who cares a lot about details. One person who comes quickly to mind is </span><span class="c2 c22 c0">BCnrd</span><span class="c2 c22 c0">&nbsp;[Brian Conrad]. BCnrd was one of the mathematicians who proved the Modularity Theorem, which showed that all elliptic curves over QQ are modular.

As explained in the comments to Pete&#39;s answer, BCnrd says there&#39;s really no issue at all in Wiles&#39;s proof. All of the specific things that Wiles uses stay far away from any of the difficult issues where you might be worried about needing to invoke universes.&quot;</span><sup class="c2 c22 c0"><a href="#ftnt81" id="ftnt_ref81">[81]</a></sup></p><p class="c4 c15"><span class="c13 c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c13 c2 c16">Brian Conrad says that the Grothendieck universes in Wiles&rsquo; proof can be avoided. Therefore, the ontological commitments of Fermat&rsquo;s Last Theorem can be bypassed. Should we accept such an ontology for topos theory (as was practiced by Grothendieck)? These questions are ultimately existence questions. But even category theory itself does not have the power to even defend the existence of its own categories!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7 c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c2 c22 c0">The second argument against the autonomy of categorical foundations has been called the &ldquo;mismatch objection&rdquo;. It concerns the general status of category theory or topos theory; and it is based on the distinction between two ways of understanding mathematical axioms, namely as &ldquo;structural&rdquo;, &ldquo;algebraic&rdquo;, &ldquo;schematic&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hilbertian&rdquo;, on the one hand, and as &ldquo;assertoric&rdquo; or &ldquo;Fregean&rdquo;, on the other hand. As Hellman argues, foundational systems such as classical set theory need to be assertoric in character, in the sense that their axioms describe a comprehensive universe of objects used for the codification of other mathematical structures. Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory is an assertoric, &ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c22 c0">contentual</span><span class="c13 c2 c0">&rdquo; theory in this sense. Its axioms (e.g., the power set axiom or the axiom of choice) make general existence claims regarding the objects in the universe of sets.</span></p><p class="c4 c15"><span class="c13 c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c2 c22 c0">In contrast, category theory represents a branch of abstract algebra, as its origin reveals. Thus it is, by its very nature, non-assertoric in character; it lacks existence axioms conceived as truths about an intended universe. For example, the Eilenberg-Mac Lane axioms of category theory are not &ldquo;basic truths simpliciter&rdquo;, but &ldquo;schematic&rdquo; or &ldquo;structural&rdquo; in character. They function as implicit definitions of algebraic structures, similar to the way in which the axioms of group theory or ring theory are &ldquo;defining conditions on types of structures&rdquo;. This point is related to another argument against the autonomy of category theory that Hellmann calls the &ldquo;problem of the &lsquo;home address&rsquo;: where do categories come from and where do they live?&rdquo; (2003: 136). Given the &ldquo;algebraic-structuralist perspective&rdquo; underlying category theory and general topos theory, its axioms make no assertions that particular categories or topoi actually exist. Classical set theories, such as ZFC with its strong existence axioms, have to step in again in order to secure the existence of such objects.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13 c2 c16"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2 c22">We can define axiomatically what a group or ring is by means of abstract algebra, but can we prove that these structures exist?

Category theory has led to reconceptualizations of various areas of mathematics based on purely abstract foundations. Moreover, when developed in a categorical framework, traditional boundaries between disciplines are shattered and reconfigured; to mention but one important example, topos theory provides a direct bridge between algebraic geometry and logic, to the point where certain results in algebraic geometry are directly translated into logic and vice versa. Certain concepts that were geometrical in origin are more clearly seen as logical (for example, the notion of coherent topos). Algebraic topology also lurks in the background. (See, for instance, Caramello 2018 for a systematic exploitation of the idea of toposes as bridges in mathematics.)

We can extrapolate and take limits, but usually those limits are sequential, so even in theory we cannot make use of more than countably many measurements. The resulting spaces are separable. Even if we use a nonseparable space such as L&infin;, this may be merely to simplify our notation; the relevant action may all be happening in some separable subspace, which we could identify with just a bit more effort. (Thus, in some sense, nonseparable spaces exist only in the imagination of mathematicians.)

It states that it is possible to have a &ldquo;choice function,&rdquo; which chooses an element from a collection each time, for an infinite amount of collections. The Axiom of Choice leads to the Banach-Tarski paradox, which roughly says one ball can be decomposed and reassembled into two balls, which seems to contradict the Law of Conservation of Mass. But what is important to note is, these sets do not have volume, so it does not lead to any contradiction in physics since these sets are not Lebesgue measurable. The axiom of choice can be replaced by less controversial cases such as countable choice or dependent choice. Most physicists deal with cases that require only finitely many measurements. But Stephen Hawking had even once invoked the Axiom of Choice to prove a theorem.</span><sup class="c2 c22"><a href="#ftnt90" id="ftnt_ref90">[90]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13 c2 c16"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2 c22">The Axiom of Choice is equivalent to Zorn&rsquo;s lemma. &nbsp;Zorn&rsquo;s lemma states &ldquo;Suppose a partially ordered set P has the property that every chain in P has an upper bound in P.

But we are not throwing the baby out with the bathwater, purely on the existence of a basis. Surely, a Linear Algebra student would say the existence of a basis for a vector space is not much to assume. Oswald Wiener has criticized the cybernetic paradigm we live in due to the research of Norbert Wiener, going so far to say, &ldquo;&ldquo;SCIENCE AND BARBARISM GO VERY WELL TOGETHER&ldquo;.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13 c2 c16"></span></p><p class="c17 c15"><span class="c13 c2 c0">Because if one thing is clear, it&rsquo;s that science and barbarism go very well together. The scientists needn&rsquo;t necessarily be barbarians themselves, they need only shut their eyes or want to live nice lives or have a voice within the structures of power. The stagnation isn&rsquo;t just in the social or aesthetic fields, but is also present in the natural sciences. In physics there has been no new idea that has really pushed things forwards for a hundred years. This is perhaps putting it very crudely, but thousands of the best researchers would cut off their own right arm to have an idea that amounted to a comparable scientific advance as quantum physics a hundred years ago. All kinds of things are going on, but, in the best cybernetic tradition, the simulation apparatuses are reconciling the contradictions between the theories of physics &ndash; it&rsquo;s known as a &ldquo;handshake&rdquo; &ndash; and innovation is being thwarted. Many of the simulation techniques used by physics are successful: weather forecasting, for example, has become a lot better, but they cannot explain why. The method is to calculate on different levels that are incompatible with each other. These different levels are then glued together by a form of creative accounting. The glue they use is the same cybernetic kind that I make fun of in the improvement of central europe. It&rsquo;s a pure invention, a fiction, but nevertheless it works.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13 c2 c16"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2 c22">What exactly are these contradictions which are presupposed by cybernetics? The axiom of Choice at the cybernetic level, supposes a choice function exists to choose an element, an infinite amount of times. This can be thought of as a decision. Because of the halting problem, there is a limit to when a computer can halt by itself and can instead remain in a loop.

In even the most rudimentary cases, one finds these reactions of attraction and repulsion. I believe that the sense of the sacred in human beings is characterized by the fact that this axis of attraction/ repulsion can, in some sense, become self-referencing through being compactified by a point at infinity. This point at infinity is precisely what we call the sacred. Stated differently, a sense of the sacred is aroused every time we find ourselves in the presence of a form which appears to be endowed with infinite power, and which is simultaneously attractive and repulsive. As these two infinities are in opposition, one becomes immobilized relative to this form: Its fascination causes motion to cease.

In contrast, along category-theoretic lines mathematical theorems do not involve such ontological commitments.

The pieces in the Banach-Tarski decomposition are not Lebesgue measurable. Thus, the Banach-Tarski Paradox gives as a corollary the fact that there exist sets that are not Lebesgue measurable. That corollary also has a much shorter proof (not involving the Banach-Tarski Paradox) which can be found in every introductory textbook on measure theory, but it too uses the Axiom of Choice...</span><span class="c2 c22 c0">Here is a brief sketch of that shorter proof: Work in &quot;the real numbers modulo 1&quot; -- that is, the number system that you get if you cut the interval [0,1) out of the real line and loop it around into a circle, so that 0 and 1 are the same number. (Like the way that 0 and 12 are the same on a circular clock.) In that number system, multiplication and division don&#39;t really work very well any more, but addition and subtraction still work fine, and so does Lebesgue measure. Let&#39;s call that number system T; its entire measure is 1. Now, the Axiom of Choice is used to &quot;construct&quot; a rather peculiar subset of T -- let us call it C -- with the property that the sets C+r = {x+r : x in C} are all disjoint from each other, for different values of the rational number r. The union of these sets is all of T. Now, if C were measurable, then so would each C+r, and they would all have the same measure, and their measures would add up to the measure of T -- that is, they would add up to 1. But how many of these C+r are there? There are a countable infinity of them. If the measure of C were zero, their sum would be zero. If the measure of C were positive, their sum would be infinite. You can&#39;t get 1, either way&rdquo;</span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref90" id="ftnt90">[90]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c19 c0"><a class="c20" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://mathoverflow.net/questions/260057/axiom-of-choice-banach-tarski-and-reality&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587409997176000">https://mathoverflow.net/questions/260057/axiom-of-choice-banach-tarski-and-reality</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">&ldquo;</span><span class="c0 c28">Arguments from physics may not help.

Ellis using the axiom of choice in 1973: </span><span class="c29 c30 c2 c28 c0">The book also contains one failure to distinguish between mathematics and physics that is actually serious. This is in the proof of the main theorem of chapter 7, that given a set of Cauchy data on a smooth spacelike hypersurface there exists a unique maximal development therefrom of Einstein&rsquo;s empty-space equations. The proof, essentially due to Choquet-Bruhat and Geroch, makes use of the axiom of choice, in the guise of Zorn&rsquo;s lemma. Now mathematicians may use this axiom if they wish, but it has no place in physics. Physicists are already stretching things, from an operational standpoint, in using the axiom of infinity. It is not a question here of resurrecting an old and out-of-date mathematical controversy. The simple fact is that the axiom of choice never is really needed except when dealing with sets and relations in non-constructive ways. Many remarkable and beautiful theorems can be proved only with its aid. But its irrelevance to physics should be evident from the fact that its denial, as Paul Cohen has shown us, is equally consistent with the other axioms of set theory. And these other axioms suffice for the constructions of the real numbers, Hilbert spaces, C* algebras, and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds&ndash;that is, of all the paraphernalia of theoretical physics. In &ldquo;proving&rdquo; the global Cauchy development theorem with the aid of Zorn&rsquo;s lemma what one is actually doing is assuming that a &ldquo;choice function&rdquo; exists for every set of developments extending a given Cauchy development. This, of course, is begging the question. The physicist&rsquo;s job is not done until he can show, by an explicit algorithm or construction, how one could in principle always select a member from every such set of developments. Failing that he has proved nothing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7 c0"></span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref91" id="ftnt91">[91]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c19 c2"><a class="c20" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2014/REUPapers/Barnum.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587409997177000">http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2014/REUPapers/Barnum.pdf</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref92" id="ftnt92">[92]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c19 c2"><a class="c20" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ericmschmid.com/Emily_Harvey_Show.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587409997177000">https://www.ericmschmid.com/Emily_Harvey_Show.pdf</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref93" id="ftnt93">[93]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c19 c0"><a class="c20" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://whatpipeline.com/exhibitions/33kavitabschmid/stage.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587409997178000">http://whatpipeline.com/exhibitions/33kavitabschmid/stage.pdf</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref94" id="ftnt94">[94]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c19 c0"><a class="c20" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Simondon&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587409997150000">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Simondon</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref95" id="ftnt95">[95]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c19 c0"><a class="c20" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Comparing_Objects&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587409997151000">https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Comparing_Objects</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref96" id="ftnt96">[96]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c19 c0"><a class="c20" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Comparing_Objects&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587409997151000">https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Comparing_Objects</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref97" id="ftnt97">[97]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c19 c0"><a class="c20" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587409997150000">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref98" id="ftnt98">[98]</a><span class="c19 c0"><a class="c20" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TotallyOrderedSet.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587409997179000">https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TotallyOrderedSet.html</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref99" id="ftnt99">[99]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c19 c0"><a class="c20" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2670231/a-countable-zorns-lemma&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587409997178000">https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2670231/a-countable-zorns-lemma</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref100" id="ftnt100">[100]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c19 c0"><a class="c20" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-interesting-examples-of-uncountable-sets&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587409997179000">https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-interesting-examples-of-uncountable-sets</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref101" id="ftnt101">[101]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c19 c0"><a class="c20" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fermentmagazine.org/Stories/Thom/Predire.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587409997168000">https://www.fermentmagazine.org/Stories/Thom/Predire.pdf</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c6"><a href="#ftnt_ref102" id="ftnt102">[102]</a><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c19 c0"><a class="c20" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.generation-online.org/p/fpdeleuze3.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587409997179000">https://www.generation-online.org/p/fpdeleuze3.htm</a></span></p></div></body></html>
